Title: Local Polynomial Regression with Option for Explicit Boundary Adjustment
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Sven", "Jacobs", email = "s.jacobs@uni-bonn.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package implements the local polynomial regression estimator
    of arbitrary degree. Estimates for the regression function (conditional mean),
    its first and second derivative can be obtained. Moreover, computation of
    effective kernels (i.e. effectively assigned weights in the kernel smoothing
    process) is provided. Different compactly supported kernels (Uniform,
    Epanechnikov, etc.) are available. For local constant regression
    (Nadaraya-Watson), explicit boundary adjustment via boundary kernels can be
    conducted. Different boundary kernels are available. Additional functionality
    includes bandwidth selection via cross-validation and the computation of
    asymptotic confidence intervals.
